# 2. Architecture Constraints

The following sections define constraints that must be adhered to

## 2.1 Technical Constraints

- All financial operations must be ACID-compliant.
- The system must ensure business logic is fully decoupled from interfaces.

- The system must not perform any accounting action unless the domain (individual, sole trader, or organization) is clearly defined.
- The system must ensure that transaction records are immutable and auditable. For example, a transaction once posted cannot be deleted; it should be voided by another transaction instead.

- The system must allow users to seamlessly switch between the accounting domains they own or manage on the platform.
- The system must support the calculation of consolidated Networth based on the financial records of a user across their accounting domains, handling any cross-currency conversions using system exchange rates.
