# 12. Glossary

This section defines the most important domain and technical terms used throughout the LedgerNova architectural documentation and source code. It ensures that all stakeholders—from accountants to software engineers—share a ubiquitous language.

## 12.1 Accounting & Business Context

| **Double-Entry**        | A foundational accounting constraint ensuring every financial transaction affects at least two accounts, with total Debits equaling total Credits to maintain a perfectly balanced equation.                          |
| **General Ledger (GL)** | The master set of accounts that summarize all transactions occurring within an accounting domain.                                                                                                                     |
| **Journal Entry**       | The fundamental record of a business transaction in the accounting system. In LedgerNova, it is immutable once posted.                                                                                                |

| **Append-Only Pattern**        | An architectural constraint applied to financial records where state changes are recorded sequentially. `UPDATE` or `DELETE` mutations are strictly prohibited to guarantee an unalterable audit trail.                                                      |
| **Coolify**                    | An open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) used by LedgerNova to manage and orchestrate all isolated Docker containers on a self-hosted DigitalOcean server.                                                                                                |
| **Correlation ID**             | A unique trace identifier attached to system requests to track down the complete lifecycle of a transaction across internal event buses and third-party APIs.                                                                                                |
| **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** | The core architectural approach used in LedgerNova, where the system is divided into strict Layers (Interface, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) and mapped to bounded contexts (Accounting, Tax, User, etc.) to securely isolate complex business rules. |
| **Domain Events**              | Asynchronous signals emitted by the application logic when a core entity changes state (e.g., "TransactionPosted"). The autonomous Tax Engine listens to these to calculate compliance independent of the core loop.                                         |
| **Doppler**                    | The centralized secret and configuration management platform. It securely injects encrypted keys into the Node.js Docker environment upon startup, completely avoiding raw `.env` files.                                                                     |
| **Drizzle ORM**                | A strict, type-safe SQL query builder used in the Infrastructure layer to bridge TypeScript models natively to the PostgreSQL database.                                                                                                                      |
| **Idempotency Key**            | A unique identifier passed with requests to guarantee that if a network failure causes an automated retry, an operation (e.g., charging a card or recording a journal entry) executes exactly once.                                                          |
| **LedgerNova Core**            | The central Node.js backend application encapsulating all business logic, double-entry constraints, and immutable database interactions.                                                                                                                     |

| **Mono**                       | A third-party open banking platform securely integrated to ingest and parse live banking feeds for automated transaction reconciliations.                                                                                                                    |
| **Qdrant**                     | A vector database used within the LedgerNova ecosystem to persist and index semantic context embeddings, critically enabling advanced AI capabilities.                                                                                                       |
