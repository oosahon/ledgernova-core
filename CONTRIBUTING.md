# Contributing to Purple Ledger

This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project to ensure a smooth workflow and high-quality code.

## Design Pattern

### Pragmatic Functional OOP

- All entities, services, repos, and use-cases are pure functions (causing no side effect).
- All similar functions are grouped in an immutable object
- Function/Methods do not call external services directly. Dependencies are wired up in `index.ts` of each sub-layer.\
  for example, `app/use-cases/categories/index.ts` or `infra/services/index.ts`.

### Event-Driven Pattern and Immutability

- Domain entity creations or mutations MUST return both the new entity state and any corresponding domain events (e.g., `return [entity, events]`).
- Domain publishing is done on the application layer.

- **Strong Immutability**: All domain entities and state objects MUST be deeply frozen (e.g., using `deepFreeze()`) to prevent accidental mutations.\
  See `src/domain/transaction/entities/transaction.entity.ts` for reference.

### Folder Structure

For the folder structure, we have favored Domain Driven Design.\
Here are the top level folders you would find on the application:

```text

src/
├─ app/                 # Application layer: orchestrates use-cases, handles commands, maps data between domain and external interfaces
│  ├─ bootstrap/        # Application bootstrap logic and server initialization
│  ├─ contracts/        # Defines infrastructure services interfaces (contracts) used in the application. (Only use-cases/* uses actual implementations)
│  ├─ events/           # Application events: domain or feature events that trigger async behavior
│  ├─ mappers/          # Mapping between domain entities and application interfaces
│  └─ usecases/         # Usecases: concrete business operations, orchestrating domain entities, repos, and services.
│
├─ domain/              # Domain layer: core business logic, entities, repo interfaces and rules
│
├─ infra/               # Technical layer: implementations of services, database, and infrastructure concerns
│  ├─ config/           # Configuration files for app, environment variables, secrets, and third-party services
│  ├─ db/               # Database-specific implementations (e.g., drizzle schemas and repo implementations)
│  ├─ observability/    # Logging, metrics, monitoring, and tracing
│  ├─ server/           # Express (or other HTTP) server setup and bootstrapping
│  └─ services/         # External service clients (e.g., third-party API clients)
│
├─ interface/           # Application entry points and external interfaces
│  ├─ http/             # API REST endpoints, controllers, handlers, and middlewares
│  └─ mcp/              # MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoints
│
└─ shared/              # Shared utilities and types used across multiple layers
   ├─ types/            # Global TypeScript types and interfaces
   ├─ utils/            # Helper functions, constants, and reusable utilities
   └─ value-objects/    # Shared value objects and related entities

```

## Domain Documentation

Contributors should see further documentations in the `__docs__` folder within the `domain` layer for the respective domains.

## Git Workflow

To maintain a clean and organized codebase, please follow these strict git workflow guidelines.

### Branching Strategy

- **`development`**: This is the main branch for development. All contributor Pull Requests (PRs) should be merged into `development`.
- **`staging`**: This branch is for pre-release testing. Code from the `development` branch is merged here.
- **`main`**: This is the production branch. Only the `staging` branch and hotfix branches are merged here.

### Feature Branches

- **Source**: Every new branch must be created off the `development` branch.
- **Target**: Every update must be submitted as a PR to the `development` branch.
- **Naming Convention**:
  - Branches should be named using the format: `<type>/<description-with-hyphens>-<optional-issue-id>`
  - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `doc`
  - **Examples**:
    - `feat/add-accounts-endpoint-49494`
    - `fix/login-error`

### Commit Messages & Pull Requests

We enforce a specific commit message format to generate clean changelogs and track history effectively.

- **Format**:
  ```text
  <type>(<domain>): <short description> <optional-id>
  ```
- **Rules**:
  - Pull request titles should also have the commit message structure.
  - PRs must be squashed and merged.
- **Examples**:
  - `feat(accounts): add endpoint to create account 3442`
  - `test(auth): improves smoke test`

## Testing

Our project follows these guidelines for testing:

- **Test Proximity**: Test files should be kept near their test subjects.
- **`__tests__` (`.test` files)**: Used for unit tests. Domain entity factories are never mocked and must use `__tests__` with `.test` files.
- **`__specs__` (`.spec` files)**: Used for integration tests where dependency injection is important. Contributors should use `__specs__` with `.spec` files for these scenarios.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: All E2E testing is handled in the frontend repository.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create a ticket for it on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/oosahon/ledgernova-core/issues).
Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to see if it has already been reported.

- **Requirement**: Every bug report must have a corresponding ticket.
- **Format**: The ticket must clearly specify:
  1.  **Expected Behaviour**: What should happen.
  2.  **Current Behaviour**: What is actually happening.
